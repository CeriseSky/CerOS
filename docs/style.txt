===CerOS Style Guidelines===

==Contents==
  - General
  - Licenses & Projects
  - Constants In Code
  - Commands

==General==
  - All files must have a maximum name length of 8, and a maximum extension
    length of 3 (e.g. "elloello.yay" is valid, and "byebyebye.nonono" is not)
  - Text files must not exceed 80 columns on one line
  - Indentation is preferred to be in spaces rather than tabs, and should have
    a width of 2 spaces. For files like the makefile, tabs are used instead,
    but should still be counted as taking up 2 of the 80 columns

==Licenses & Projects==
  - License notice should be given at the beginning of each licensed text file.
    If the file is not plain text and the language used does not support
    comments, then license notice can be omitted from the file.
  - License notice should include a notice of which project the text file
    belongs to.
  - The main project licenses should be present in each project's root directory
    and any additional licenses should be in the project's licenses directory
    with the path <license name>/<project the license is for>.txt.
  - Files that belong in the same project should be grouped together, though
    this can be ignored if the file is more useful in another location, such as
    the license overview document being in the licenses directory rather than
    the docs directory.

==Language==
  - Documentation and comments should be written in good English.
  - British and American English are both accepted and can be used
    interchangably
  - Currently, only C and Assembly are expected to be used in the operating
    system code. However, generic tools can be written in any language, and
    discussions can be started for incorporating other languages in the CerOS
    code.

==Constants In Code==
  - Magic numbers should never be used in CerOS code. They hurt readability and
    changeability far too much for any project, let alone operating system code.
  - Magic numbers should be replaced with constants, or combinations of
    constants, that have descriptive names to make the functionality of code
    obvious and easy to change.
  - Constants should avoid being redeclared. Instead, source files should
    include header files that already declare these constants. This isn't always
    a strict requirement, especially if the header files are not part of the
    same project, or if the file is intended to be distributed by itself - as is
    the case with the CerOS Boot Sector.
  - Files that intentionally do not include other files should give a notice of
    this intention.

==Commands==
  - In markdown files, commands must go in blocks like the readme file does.
  - Markdown files do not need to differentiate specify user commands ($) unless
    root commands (#) are also used in the same file. Root commands must always
    be specified.
  - Plain text files must always specify the user prompt or root prompt, and the
    command prompt must be indented from the text around it
  - required arguments for a command are surrounded by angle brackets < >, and
    optional arguments are surrounded by box brackets [ ].
  - An example user command might look like:
      $ MyCommand <arg1> [arg2]
